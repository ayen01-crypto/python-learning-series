# Lesson 03: Control Flow (if/else, loops)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Use conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Understand comparison and logical operators
- Master for loops and while loops
- Control loop execution (break, continue, pass)
- Handle nested loops and conditions

## 📖 Theory

### Conditional Statements
Make decisions in your code based on conditions:
```python
if condition:
    # code block
elif another_condition:
    # code block
else:
    # code block
```

### For Loops
Iterate over sequences (lists, strings, ranges):
```python
for item in sequence:
    # code block
```

### While Loops
Repeat while condition is True:
```python
while condition:
    # code block
```

### Loop Control
- `break`: Exit loop entirely
- `continue`: Skip to next iteration
- `pass`: Do nothing (placeholder)

## 💻 Examples

See `examples.py` for comprehensive demonstrations.

## 🚀 Mini Project: Adventure Game

Create an interactive text-based adventure game with choices and consequences!

**File**: `project_adventure_game.py`

## 🎓 Key Takeaways
- Indentation defines code blocks in Python
- Use `elif` for multiple conditions (not `else if`)
- `range()` generates sequences of numbers
- Loops can be nested
- Always ensure while loops can terminate

## 💪 Practice Challenges

1. Create a number guessing game
2. Build a simple calculator with menu
3. Make a password strength checker
4. Write FizzBuzz (print numbers 1-100, "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for 5)
